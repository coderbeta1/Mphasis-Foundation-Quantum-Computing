Quantum and Classical Pathfinding and Airline Re-accommodation

Overview
The project aims at addressing the challenge of passenger re-accommodation due to planned schedule changes in airlines. The key objectives include identifying impacted flights and passengers, determining suitable alternate flights, ranking alternate flight solutions, and prioritizing PNR re-accommodation. 
The solution incorporates a business rule engine for flexibility in rule application and produces two sets of solution files: a default flight level re-accommodation solution and an exception list for individual PNR re-accommodation. The project emphasizes the creation of various rule profiles, flexibility in rule enforcement, and the generation of comprehensive solution files catering to different scenarios.

Files Description

Python Scripts
    * classical_re-assignment_greedy.py ##
    * find_impacted_passengers: Identifies passengers affected by flight changes.    
    * calc_score: Calculates scores for reassignment options.
    * find_possible_paths: Determines potential paths for reassignment.
    * main: The main function orchestrating the process.
    * PNRS: Manages Passenger Name Records.
    * classical_pathfinding.py
    * Multiple functions including _init_, statistics_printer, reduce_network, calc_score, recurse, solver, 
    * multisolve, solve, find_impacted_passengers, and matrix_finder, all contributing to the classical approach to pathfinding.
    * CLASSICAL_FINAL.py
    * main: The final integration of classical pathfinding and reassignment methods.
    * QUANTUM_FINAL.py
    * In this file, we have formulated our solution into two sub problems:
    * the first part focuses on path finding where we have modelled our problem into a Constrained Quadratic Model(CQM)
    * The second part focuses on passenger 
    * re-accomodation(which we modelled as a CQM too)and generating the solution files.
    * Functions like next_72hrsflights, get_direct_flights, get_1_interconnecting, get_2_interconnecting are being defined for flight data reduction.
    * encode_flights, decode, and main to implement D-Wave’s HybridCQM Sampler to solve our CQM Model for the project.
    * Nearby_Airports.py
    * nearby_airport: Finds airports in close proximity to a given location.
    * pnr_reaccomodation.py:Py file containing the below functions and classes for Flights and Passenger.
    * build_knapsack_cqm: Builds a Constrained Quadratic Model for the knapsack problem involving passenger re-accommodation.
    * parse_solution: Interprets solver results for re-accommodation.
    * reaccomodation: Applies a CQM solver to the knapsack problem in passenger re-accommodation.
    * path_scoring.py: Contains classes to score flight paths and PNRs
    * Functions for scoring flights including next_72hrsflights, get_direct_flights, get_1_interconnecting, get_2_interconnecting, encode_flights, and decode_and_retrieve_flights.
